What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

What happens is that it displays a message which says "Initialized empty Git repository" and I only need the next command: git init, when I am at the directory I want to make a git repository.Then I may also wish to run git status after I have created the file. Because I should see that now the files within the repository are listed as untracked files.
			
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is different from the working directory because it only contains the files I want to track with git, while the working directory contains all the files, eventhough I don't want to track them. THe satging area is different from the repository, because a repository contains the commits, while the satging area only contains the files I want to commit.

change?
